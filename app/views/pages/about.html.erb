  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <hr/>
  <p>
  GoJournalism is a non-profit project that is funded, owned and operated by the Algonquin College Journalism program in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, and administered by the collegeâ€™s applied research department. We are an open source project to pioneer Ottawa-based community powered reporting. Through GoJournalism the public can commission and participate with journalists to do reporting on important and perhaps overlooked topics. And journalists can pitch stories they hope would be funded directly by the public or mainstream news organizations.
